# Knapsack Algorithm Visualization

[![Project Tests](https://github.com/MonicaG/knapsack-algorithm-visualization/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MonicaG/knapsack-algorithm-visualization/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**This is a work in progress. Not all features are working/implemented yet!**

This project was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). 

This is a hobby project to learn ReactJS and Tailwind CSS.

The goal is to build the Knapsack Algorithm interactively so a user can see the algorithm in action.
